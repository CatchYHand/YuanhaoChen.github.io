<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome to my homepage! I am a graduate student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Arizona State University. I have a profound passion for robotic modeling and control, bio-robots, machine learning, and human kinematics. 

At the Neuromuscular Control and Human Robotics Laboratory at ASU, I designed a comprehensive experimental framework to assess the stability enhancement of a back-support device with variable stiffness settings during various daily tasks. My work includes employing statistical methods to analyze the device's biomechanical impact and conducting quantitative evaluations to establish a correlation between the device's stiffness and dynamic balance.

I have demonstrated my skills and knowledge through various projects, including the vision-impaired friendly assistive mobile device, an automated conveyor operating system, and an automated curtain system. I am proficient in multiple programming languages, such as C, Matlab, Python, VB, etc. I'm also good at using software tools like OpenSim, Vicon Nexus, Arduino, etc.

I enjoy playing the piano, board games, tennis, and outdoor activities in my free time.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn.
