In this project, we explored the integration of deep learning into the RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm to enhance its efficiency in path planning. By training a neural network to improve the sampling method within the RRT* framework, we aimed to optimize path costs and increase the success rate of finding collision-free paths in complex environments. Our methodology involved generating a large dataset of random mazes, applying a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for more targeted sampling, and evaluating the results against traditional uniform sampling. The findings showed a significant improvement in path efficiency and success rates when using learned samples, indicating the potential of deep learning in enhancing traditional path-planning algorithms.
